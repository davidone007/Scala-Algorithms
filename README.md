### Implementation Overview

This GitHub repository contains the implementation of three divide and conquer algorithms in Scala, as part of the Integrative Assignment 1 for the Computer Science and Discrete Structures II course. The primary focus of this assignment is to apply functional programming principles, recursion, and pattern matching to solve the following problems:

#### Problem 1: Binary Search
In this problem, we will implement the binary search algorithm to efficiently search sorted lists. The algorithm will be developed in Scala, and functional programming techniques will be applied.

#### Problem 2: Majority Element
The goal is to check whether an input sequence contains a majority element. A divide-and-conquer algorithm with a time complexity of O(n log n) will be designed and implemented in Scala to solve this problem efficiently.

#### Problem 3: Organizing a Lottery
This problem involves organizing an online lottery where participants bet on a single integer, and their payoffs are calculated based on the number of segments containing their chosen number. An efficient algorithm will be developed in Scala to compute the payoffs for all participants.

The code will be organized into separate Scala files within the "main" folder, and unit tests will be included in the "test" folder. The entire implementation will follow functional programming paradigms, using immutable data structures, recursion, and pattern matching.
